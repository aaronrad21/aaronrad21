<span id="a">Hi!</span> I'm Aaron Rad

<span>
4 years ago, I was put into a conversion therapy program shortly after coming out.
In these sessions, I started to disassociate from reality and my preconceived identity.
For years, I was drifting through life; subconsciously suffering from my previous experiences. 
My inability to cope with prior trauma was not only hurting me, but the people around me as well. 
In attempt to heal past wounds, I documented my conversion therapy experience in the form of music. 
With the help of a friend, I was able to draw out my pain and transform it into something beautiful, <span id="b">suffering ID</span>.
